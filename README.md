# #1 Pass by Value and Pass by Reference
Pass by Value and Pass by reference is the two ways by which we can pass a value to the variable in a function.

- Pass by Value: It is a process in which the function parameter values are copied to another variable and instead this object copied is passed. This is known as call by Value.
- Pass by Reference: It is a process in which the actual copy of reference is passed to the function. This is called by Reference.

Talking about Java, we can say that Java is Pass by Value and not pass by reference.

# #2 equal()
The equals() method is a static method of the Objects class that accepts two objects and checks if the objects are equal.

- If both the objects point to null, then equals() returns true.
- If any one of the objects points to null, then equals() returns false.
- If both the objects are equal, then equals() returns true.
- Otherwise, we use the equals method of the first argument to determine equality.
